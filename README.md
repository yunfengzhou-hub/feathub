# Feathub

Feathub is a feature store that facilitates feature development and deployment
to achieve the following objectives:
- **Reduce duplication of data engineering efforts** by allowing new ML projects
  to reuse and share a library of curated production-ready features already
  registered by existing projects in the same organization.
- **Simplify feature management** by allowing users to specify feature
  definitions and feature processing jobs as code using a declarative framework.
- **Facilitate feature development-to-deployment iteration** by allowing users
  to use the same declarative feature definitions across training and serving,
  online and offline, without training-serving skew. Feathub takes care of
  compiling feature definitions into efficient processing jobs and executing those
  jobs in a distributed cluster.

Feathub provides SDK and infra that enable the following capabilities:
- Define feature-view (a group of related features) as transformations and joins
  of the existing feature-views and data sources.
- Register and retrieve feature-views by names from feature registry.
- Transform and materialize features for the given time range and/or keys from the
  feature view into feature stores, by applying transformations on source
  dataset with point-in-time correctness.
- Fetch online features by joining features from online feature store with
  on-demand transformations.

The figure above shows how a developer can use FeatHub to facilitate feature
engineering for model training and model inference. Please checkout [Feathub
architecture and concepts](docs/architecture.md) for more details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites for building python packages:
- Unix-like operating system (e.g. Linux, Mac OS X)
- x86_64 architecture
- Python 3.7
- Pip >= 21.3
- Java 8
- Maven >= 3.1.1

### Install Feathub

#### Install Nightly Build
Run the following command to install preview(nightly) version of Feathub.
```bash
$ python -m pip install --upgrade feathub-nightly
```

#### Install From Source
Run the following command to install Feathub from source.
```bash
# Build Java dependencies for Feathub
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -f java/

# Install Feathub
$ python -m pip install ./python
```

### Supported Processor

Feathub provides different processors to compute features with different computation
engine. Here is a list of supported processors and versions:

- Local
- Flink 1.15.2

### Quickstart

#### Quickstart using Local Processor

Execute the following command to run the
[nyc_taxi.py](python/feathub/examples/nyc_taxi.py) demo which demonstrates the
capabilities described above.
```bash
$ python python/feathub/examples/nyc_taxi.py
```

#### Quickstart using Flink Processor

If you are interested in computing the Feathub features with Flink processor in a local 
Flink cluster, you can see the following quickstart with different deployment modes:

- [Flink Processor Session Mode Quickstart](docs/quickstarts/flink_processor_session_quickstart.md)
- [Flink Processor Cli Mode Quickstart](docs/quickstarts/flink_processor_cli_quickstart.md)


## Highlighted Capabilities


### Define Features via Table Joins with Point-in-Time Correctness

```python
f_price = Feature(
    name="price",
    dtype=types.Float32,
    transform=JoinTransform(
        table_name="price_update_events",
        feature_name="price"
    ),
    keys=["item_id"],
)
```

### Define Over Window Aggregation Features

```python
f_total_payment_last_two_minutes = Feature(
    name="total_payment_last_two_minutes",
    dtype=types.Float32,
    transform=OverWindowTransform(
        expr="item_count * price",
        agg_func="SUM",
        window_size=timedelta(minutes=2),
        group_by_keys=["user_id"]
    )
)
```

### Define Sliding Window Aggregation Features

```python
f_total_payment_last_two_minutes = Feature(
    name="total_payment_last_two_minutes",
    dtype=types.Float32,
    transform=SlidingWindowTransform(
        expr="item_count * price",
        agg_func="SUM",
        window_size=timedelta(minutes=2),
        step_size=timedelta(minutes=1),
        group_by_keys=["user_id"]
    )
)
```

### Define Features via Built-in Functions

```python
f_trip_time_duration = Feature(
    name="f_trip_time_duration",
    dtype=types.Int32,
    transform="UNIX_TIMESTAMP(taxi_dropoff_datetime) - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(taxi_pickup_datetime)",
)
```

### Define Feature via Python UDF

```python
f_lower_case_name = Feature(
    name="lower_case_name",
    dtype=types.String,
    transform=PythonUdfTransform(lambda row: row["name"].lower()),
)
```

## Developer Guidelines

### Installing Development Dependencies

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r python/dev-requirements.txt
```

### Generating code from Protocol Buffers files

Make sure you have installed Protocol Buffers compiler 3.17.x in your local
environment. You may refer to [Protocol Buffers'
README](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation)
for installation guidelines. 

After that, execute the following commands under Feathub's root folder to
generate the required python file.

```bash
$ FEATHUB_HOME=`pwd`
$ protoc -I=${FEATHUB_HOME}/python/feathub/common/protobuf/ --python_out=${FEATHUB_HOME}/python/feathub/common/protobuf/ featureValue.proto
```

### Running All Tests

```bash
# Build Java dependencies for Feathub
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -f java/

$ pytest -W ignore::DeprecationWarning
```

### Code Formatting

Feathub uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to format
Python code, [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to check
Python code style, and [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to check type 
annotation.

Run the following command to format codes, check code style, and check type annotation 
before uploading PRs for review.

```bash
# Format python code
$ python -m black python

# Check python code style
$ python -m flake8 --config=python/setup.cfg python

# Check python type annotation
$ python -m mypy --config-file python/setup.cfg python
```
