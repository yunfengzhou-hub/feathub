## Introduction

FeatHub is an open-source feature store designed to simplify the development and
deployment of machine learning models. It supports feature ETL and provides an
easy-to-use Python SDK that abstracts away the complexities of point-in-time
correctness needed to avoid training-serving skew. With FeatHub, data scientists
can speed up the feature deployment process and optimize feature ETL by
automatically compiling declarative feature definitions into performant
distributed ETL jobs using state-of-the-art computation engines of their choice,
such as Flink or Spark.

Checkout [Documentation](docs/content/_index.md) for guidance on compute
engines, connectors, expression language, and more.


## Core Benefits

Similar to other feature stores, FeatHub provides the following core benefits:

- **Simplified feature development**: The Python SDK provided by FeatHub makes
  it easy to develop features without worrying about point-in-time correctness.
This helps to avoid training-serving skew, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of machine learning models.
- **Faster feature deployment**: FeatHub automatically compiles user-specified
  declarative feature definitions into performant distributed ETL jobs using
state-of-the-art computation engines, such as Flink or Spark. This speeds up the
feature deployment process and eliminates the need for data engineers to
re-write Python programs into distributed stream or batch processing jobs.
- **Performant feature generation**: FeatHub offers a range of [built-in
  optimizations](docs/content/deep-dive/optimizations.md) that leverage commonly
observed feature ETL job patterns. These optimizations are automatically applied
to ETL jobs compiled from the declarative feature definitions, much like how SQL
optimizations are applied.
- **Assisted feature monitoring**: FeatHub provides built-in metrics to monitor
  the quality of features and alert users to issues such as feature drift. This
helps to improve the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models.
- **Facilitated feature sharing**: FeatHub allows developers to register, query,
  and re-use production-ready feature definitions and datasets already generated
by other developers in the organization. This reduces the duplication of data
engineering efforts and the cost of feature generation.

In addition to the above benefits, FeatHub provides several architectural
benefits compared to other feature stores, including:

- **Real-time feature generation**: FeatHub supports real-time feature
  generation using Apache Flink as the stream computation engine with milli-second
latency. This provides better performance than other open-source feature stores
that only support feature generation using Apache Spark.

- **Stream-batch unified computation**: FeatHub allows for consistent feature
  computation across offline, nearline, and online stacks using Apache Flink for
real-time features with low latency, Apache Spark for offline features with high
throughput, and FeatureService for computing features online when the request is
received.

- **Extensible framework**: FeatHub's Python SDK is declarative and decoupled
  from the APIs of the underlying computation engines, providing flexibility and
avoiding lock-in. This allows for the support of additional computation engines
in the future.

Usability is a crucial factor that sets feature store projects apart. Our SDK is
designed to be **Pythonic**, **declarative**, intuitive, and highly expressive to
support all the necessary feature transformations. We understand that a feature
store's success depends on its usability as it directly affects developers'
productivity. Check out the [FeatHub SDK Highlights](#feathub-sdk-highlights)
section below to learn more about the exceptional usability of our SDK.

## What you can do with FeatHub

With FeatHub, you can:
- **Define new features**: Define features as the result of applying
expressions, aggregations, and cross-table joins on existing features, all with
point-in-time correctness.
- **Read and write features data**: Read and write feature data into a variety
  of offline, nearline, and online [storage
systems](docs/content/connectors/_index.md) for both offline training and online
serving.
- **Backfill features data**: Process historical data with the given time range
and/or keys to backfill feature data, whic
- **Run experiments**: Run experiments on the local machine using
LocalProcessor without connecting to Apache Flink or Apache Spark cluster. Then
deploy the FeatHub program in a distributed Apache Flink or Apache Spark
cluster by changing the program configuration.

See [Basic Concepts](docs/content/concepts/basic-concepts.md) for more details about the key components in FeatHub.

## Supported Compute Engines

FeatHub supports the following compute engines to execute feature ETL pipeline:
- [Apache Flink 1.15](docs/content/engines/flink.md)
- [Aapche Spark 3.3](docs/content/engines/spark.md)
- Local processor, which is implemented using the Pandas library and computes features in the given Python process.


## FeatHub SDK Highlights

The following examples demonstrate how to define a variety of features
concisely using FeatHub SDK.

See [NYC Taxi Demo](docs/examples/nyc_taxi.ipynb) to learn more about how to
define, generate and serve features using FeatHub SDK.

- Define features via table joins with point-in-time correctness

```python
f_price = Feature(
    name="price",
    transform=JoinTransform(
        table_name="price_update_events",
        feature_name="price"
    ),
    keys=["item_id"],
)
```

- Define over-window aggregation features:

```python
f_total_payment_last_two_minutes = Feature(
    name="total_payment_last_two_minutes",
    transform=OverWindowTransform(
        expr="item_count * price",
        agg_func="SUM",
        window_size=timedelta(minutes=2),
        group_by_keys=["user_id"]
    )
)
```

- Define sliding-window aggregation features:

```python
f_total_payment_last_two_minutes = Feature(
    name="total_payment_last_two_minutes",
    transform=SlidingWindowTransform(
        expr="item_count * price",
        agg_func="SUM",
        window_size=timedelta(minutes=2),
        step_size=timedelta(minutes=1),
        group_by_keys=["user_id"]
    )
)
```

- Define features via built-in functions and the FeatHub expression language:

```python
f_trip_time_duration = Feature(
    name="f_trip_time_duration",
    transform="UNIX_TIMESTAMP(taxi_dropoff_datetime) - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(taxi_pickup_datetime)",
)
```

See [FeatHub Expression Language](docs/content/concepts/expression-language.md) for more details.

- Define a feature via Python UDF:

```python
f_lower_case_name = Feature(
    name="lower_case_name",
    dtype=types.String,
    transform=PythonUdfTransform(lambda row: row["name"].lower()),
)
```
