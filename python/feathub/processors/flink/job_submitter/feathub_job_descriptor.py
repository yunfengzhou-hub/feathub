        :param keys: Optional. If it is TableDescriptor or DataFrame, it should be
                     transformed into a table of keys. If it is not None, the
                     table only include rows whose key fields match at least one
                     row of the keys.
        :param start_datetime: Optional. If it is not None, the `features` table should
                               have a timestamp field. And the table will only
                               include features whose
                               timestamp >= start_datetime. If any field (e.g. minute)
                               is not specified in the start_datetime, we assume this
                               field has the minimum possible value.
        :param end_datetime: Optional. If it is not None, the `features` table should
                             have a timestamp field. And the table will only
                             include features whose timestamp < end_datetime. If any
                             field (e.g. minute) is not specified in the end_datetime,
                             we assume this field has the maximum possible value.
        :param sink: Where the features write to.

                                      table.

                                existing data in the given sink.
