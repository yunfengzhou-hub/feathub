    Provides metadata to access, derive and interpret a table of feature values. Each
    column of the table corresponds to a feature.

    A TableDescriptor is uniquely identified by its name in the feature registry. Its
    interpretation is agnostic to any processor type.

    TableDescriptors use `timestamp_field` and `timestamp_format` to define the time
    attribute of each row of feature value. Valid field values and formats are as
    follows.

    - If the format value is "epoch", the timestamp field should contain numeric values
      representing unix timestamps in seconds.
    - If the format value is "epoch_millis", The timestamp field should contain numeric
      values representing unix timestamps in milliseconds.
    - Otherwise, the format value should match the requirement of the C standard
      (1989 version). For example, the default valid value is "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S". The
      timestamp field should contain string values in the specified format. See Python's
      strftime() and strptime() Behavior for a brief list of and introduction to these
      format patterns.
