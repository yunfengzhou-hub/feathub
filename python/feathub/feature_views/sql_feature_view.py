    Derives features by evaluating a given SQL statement.

    Currently, the SQL statement is executed by the underlying processor's SQL interface
    without any change and therefore its semantics depends on the processor used during
    deployment.

    While executing the same SQL statement on different processors usually yields
    identical results, there is no guarantee of this. We plan to make SqlFeatureView
    processor-agnostic in the future to ensure consistent semantics regardless of
    processor choice.

    NOTE: the tables used in the SQL statement should be built with the
    FeatHubClient#build_features() before executing the SqlFeatureView.
