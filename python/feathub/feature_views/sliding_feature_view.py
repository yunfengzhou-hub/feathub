class SlidingFeatureView(FeatureView):
    """
    Derives features by applying sliding window transformations on an existing table.

    SlidingFeatureView supports ExpressionTransform, PythonUdfTransform, and
    SlidingWindowTransform, but it does not support JoinTransform or
    OverWindowTransform. SlidingWindowTransform used in this feature view must have the
    same step size and group-by keys. Those features defined with ExpressionTransform or
    PythonUdfTransform before the first SlidingWindowTransform feature must be part of
    the group-by keys of sliding window transformations used in this feature view. If
    they are defined after the first SlidingWindowTransform feature, they must only
    depend on the timestamp_field, SlidingWindowTransform features, or the group-by
    keys.

    Unlike DerivedFeatureView, the number of rows emitted by SlidingFeatureView might
    not equal the number of rows in its source table. This is because the features
    defined by a sliding window transformation can change over time even if there is no
    change in the source table.

    The output fields of this feature view consist of the features explicitly listed in
    the `features` parameter, their group-by keys, and an additional field "window_time"
    that represents the timestamp when the sliding window closed with default format
    "epoch". Other fields in the source table will not be included.

    The SlidingFeatureView can be configured with the following global configuration:
    - sdk.sliding_feature_view.enable_empty_window_output: Default to True. If it is
      True, when the sliding window becomes emtpy, it outputs zero value for aggregation
      function SUM and COUNT, and output None for other aggregation function. If it is
      False, the sliding window doesn't output anything when the sliding window becomes
      empty.
    - sdk.sliding_feature_view.skip_same_window_output: Default to True. If it is True,
      the sliding feature view only outputs when the result of the sliding window
      changes. If it is False, the sliding feature view outputs at every step size even
      if the result of the sliding window doesn't change.

    Note that setting sdk.sliding_feature_view.enable_empty_window_output to False and
    sdk.sliding_feature_view.skip_same_window_output to True is forbidden and an
    exception will be thrown, because, with this setting, we cannot determine if a
    sliding window result is expired or not.
